# visitors_repo
Visitor sign-in repository for Home Assistant integration

A simple facility visitor sign in / out tracker

This is designed to allow visitors to quickly check in to your site, while not causing any issues if they don't sign out.

We also wanted it to be quick and easy to sign out so there are no in-person traffic-jams from that taking place.
